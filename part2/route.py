"""
Abstraction Steps for the route.py file:
    State space:
        All cities. 
    Successor:
        All cities connected to that city in consideration.
    Data Structure:
        Dictionary of Lists with tuples
        Bidirectional Cities:
            Since all of the routes are Bidirectional instead of searching inner lists, 
            We first loaded the city 1 (from city) as key of the dictionary and then reloaded the toCity (the inner cities of the segments)
            as the key of the dictopnary, such that both directional searches are faster.
    Goal State:
        End City(Destination)
    Initial State:
        Start City(Source)
    Cost Function:
        Here we defined the cost function in terms of Distance, Time and segements.
        For Distance the cost function is cumulative lengths of the segments till the successor.
        For time the cost function is cumulative addition of times calculated by the segment length divided ny the speed limit.
        For segments the cost function is the cumulative addition of # of cites explored.
    Heuristic Function:
        Distance:
            We use the euclidian distance calculated by the lat long provided.
            In case lat long for a city is not present in citygps file, we take the nearest cities lat long which could be the cities at the same
            level of the graph or if all of the lat longs are missing at a particular level of the graph we would consider the lat long of the 
            parent node. If the parent node is also missing, we would take the lat longs of the siblings of the parent node.
            This is implemented by keeping the global variable of the nearest city "nearestCityWithLatLong" and updating it,
            when the successors or when a node is popped from the fringe.
        Time:
            For time to estimate the time required to the goal state from the current state we consider the maximum speed() across the
            entire segments(all roads), such that the heuristic always under-estimates the time required 65.0
        Segments:
            For segments we are dividing the Euclidian distance (heuristic) by the maximum segment length across the entire file road segments
            such that we never overestimate the actual number of segments.
        Heuristic Admissibility:
            Euclidean Distance is the shortest path between two points and hence never overestimates the actual distance.
            Hence our Heuristic is admissible and is also consistent because because of the triangular inequality for line segments. 

Assumptions:
    When the speed limit is  zero for a particular segment,we are substituted the min non zero speed in the data; 
    min non zero speed is 25 hence we are substitiutinh by 24 (could be subsitituted by any other number less than 25),
    Highest Speed Considered = 65.0,
    For missing speed limits we have substitiued by the mean of the speed limits.
Code related :
    
   1.City segments are loaded as dictionary of list of tuples  {fromcity: [(tocity1 , Dist, SpeedLimit , HighwayName),
                                                                          (tocity2 , Dist, SpeedLimit , HighwayName)  ]}
   2.For the faster loading of the files we have pickled the dictionaries and loaded the data from the 
   road segments and citygps files. please refer to the file "LoadSegements and Cities as dict of Tuples" in the part 2 directory.
   3. City gps is loaded as dictionary of dictioariy {city:{lat: ,long:}}
